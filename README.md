# **Shell Interpreter**


Shell is a utility program with the Linux system that serves as an interface between the user and the kernel and also plays a very important rule as a Command Interpreter and should be able to do the following :

* Reads the command

* Locates the file in the directories containing utilities

* Loads the utility into memory

* Executes the utility as a child of its own

## Requirements
- [ ] Accept a Linux command and execute it when the return key is pressed.
- [ ] Accept CTRL+C to print “^C” then close the current process executing in the shell.
- [ ] Implement the ampersand control operator "*&*".
- [ ] An error message should be printed on entering unsupported command.
- [ ] Use the up arrow only on your shell to retrieve the history of the commands​.
- [ ] Implement correct TAB completion for file and folder names only.
